* [Geany] - A great text editor and lightweight IDE

```

## Development

##### Editing multiple files:

First download the source code as explained above in the downloading section

Then initialize the local directory as a Git repository
```sh
$ cd ownrom-website
$ git init
```

Add the URL for the remote repository where your local repostory will be pushed.
```sh
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/OwnROM/OwnROM-Website.git
```

Then pull in any new changes
```sh
$ git pull origin master
```

You may now add/edit any files in your local respitory

After editing or adding files add the files to your local repository
```sh
$ git add .
```

Then commit the files that you've staged in your local repository
```sh
$ git commit -m 'commit text'
```

Finally push the changes in your local repository to GitHub
```sh
$ git push origin master
```

(If you get a error this usally means there has been changes in the respitory. Just use the pull command as shown above then push your changes)

##### Editing single files

There is no need to do the steps as explained above but that would work aswell.

To edit just one file click on the file in the respitory that you want to edit, hit the edit button (the pencil), edit the file as you like and subbmit it via a commit.
